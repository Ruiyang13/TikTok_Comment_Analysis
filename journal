Getting the data:
It is tough since TikTok has strict restrictions on scraping data and I do not want my account to be locked. Extensions are expensive, probabily against platform guidelines and privacy is also a concern. 
Therefore I used the dumbest way: to copy paste the comments myself. Not literally just selecting all the comments and scroll down, but still quite tedious. So I manually scrolled down and opened the replies to comments, then using java script, get the respective comment and video data. 
But the limitations are that 1. it's tedious to manually scroll down, but if i use an automatic scroller through javascript, thats against platform guidelines. 2. Not all comments are captured since sometimes human may not open all the replies under each comment.
3.
